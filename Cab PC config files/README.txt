Hello! This is the Swadge Emulator for Super 2025. You are reading this because:

1. You are setting up the cab
2. The emulator has crashed and you are lost
3. Something seems wrong with the emulator settings
4. Or, you're a nebby person

Swadge Emulator version: Swadge Release 2.1.1 + cab emulator fork 3ff6b9c

Scenario 1:

You are setting up the cab. Perform the following steps:
1. Plug in the Brook P5 Plus Fighting Board USB to the Intel Compute Stick attached to the monitor. This should already be wired to the cab.
If it is not working, check the User Guide in this folder.
If certain buttons are not working, check wiring.
2. Navigate to the desktop where you found this file. There is also a reload_emulator.bat file. Double click it, and you're done. Playtest and go get a soda.

Scenario 2:

To relaunch the emulator, run the reload_emulator.bat file. Don't close that file, just minimize it.

Scenario 3:

Run this in cmd to get it to launch correctly: swadge_emulator.exe -f --hide-leds --headless

Scenario 4:

Hi! Close this and reopen the emulator please. Go away!

Thanks, and if something's hella broken text me at 7247718991.
